To analyze the **size complexity** of the `RangeFreqQuery` class, we need to consider how much memory is used by the data structures in the worst case. The primary components contributing to memory usage are:

1. **Segment Tree Nodes**: Each node in the segment tree stores a range `[start, end]`, a `HashMap<Integer, Integer>` representing frequency counts for elements in that range, and pointers to its left and right children.

2. **HashMap Storage**: Each node contains a `HashMap` storing the frequency of elements in the corresponding range.

### Step 1: Segment Tree Structure
The segment tree is a binary tree where:
- Each leaf node corresponds to an individual element in the input array.
- Internal nodes represent ranges formed by merging their child nodes' ranges.

For an input array of size $n$, the segment tree has:
- $n$ leaf nodes (one for each element in the array).
- Approximately $n - 1$ internal nodes (since a binary tree with $n$ leaves has $2n - 1$ total nodes).

Thus, the total number of nodes in the segment tree is $O(n)$.

---

### Step 2: Memory Usage per Node
Each node in the segment tree contains:
1. **Range Information (`start`, `end`)**: These are two integers, so they occupy $O(1)$ space.
2. **HashMap (`value`)**: This stores the frequency count of elements in the range represented by the node. In the worst case:
   - If all elements in the range are distinct, the `HashMap` will store $k$ key-value pairs, where $k$ is the number of distinct elements in the range.
   - For the root node, the range covers the entire array, so the `HashMap` could store up to $d$ key-value pairs, where $d$ is the number of distinct elements in the entire array.
3. **Pointers to Children (`left`, `right`)**: These are references to other nodes, so they occupy $O(1)$ space.

Thus, the memory usage of a single node depends on the size of its `HashMap`. In the worst case, the root node's `HashMap` can store $d$ entries, while leaf nodes store only one entry.

---

### Step 3: Total Memory Usage
To compute the total memory usage, we sum up the contributions from all nodes in the segment tree:
1. **Leaf Nodes**: There are $n$ leaf nodes, and each stores a `HashMap` with exactly one entry (the frequency of the single element it represents). Thus, the total memory usage for all leaf nodes is $O(n)$.
2. **Internal Nodes**: There are approximately $n - 1$ internal nodes. The size of the `HashMap` in an internal node depends on the number of distinct elements in the range it represents. In the worst case:
   - The root node's `HashMap` stores $d$ entries.
   - Other internal nodes store fewer entries, depending on the distinct elements in their respective ranges.

In the worst case, the total number of entries across all `HashMap`s in the segment tree is proportional to the sum of the sizes of all ranges. Since each element in the array contributes to the `HashMap` of at most $O(\log n)$ nodes (due to the height of the segment tree), the total memory usage for all `HashMap`s is $O(d \log n)$, where $d$ is the number of distinct elements in the array.

Adding the memory for range information and child pointers, which is $O(n)$, the total size complexity is dominated by the `HashMap` storage.

### Final Size Complexity
The total size complexity of the `RangeFreqQuery` class is:

$$
\boxed{O(n + d \log n)}
$$

Where:
- $n$ is the size of the input array.
- $d$ is the number of distinct elements in the array.

This accounts for the memory used by the segment tree structure and the `HashMap`s storing frequency counts.
