---

### **Slide 2: Introduction to SOLID Principles**
**Title:** What are SOLID Principles?  
**Content:**  
- SOLID is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.  
- Introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob).  
- Applicable to object-oriented programming (OOP) languages like Java.  

**SOLID Stands For:**  
1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
2. **O**pen/Closed Principle (OCP)  
3. **L**iskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### **Slide 3: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
**Title:** Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
**Core Meaning:**  
- A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one job or responsibility.  

**Intention:**  
- Improves readability, maintainability, and testability.  
- Reduces coupling between classes.  

**Code Snippet:**  
```java
// Bad Example: A class with multiple responsibilities
class User {
    void login() { /* Login logic */ }
    void sendEmail() { /* Email logic */ }
}

// Good Example: Separate responsibilities
class User {
    void login() { /* Login logic */ }
}

class EmailService {
    void sendEmail() { /* Email logic */ }
}
```

---

### **Slide 4: Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
**Title:** Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
**Core Meaning:**  
- Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.  

**Intention:**  
- Allows adding new features without altering existing code.  
- Promotes the use of abstractions and interfaces.  

**Code Snippet:**  
```java
// Bad Example: Modifying existing class for new shapes
class Rectangle {
    void draw() { /* Draw rectangle */ }
}

// Good Example: Extending functionality without modifying existing code
interface Shape {
    void draw();
}

class Rectangle implements Shape {
    public void draw() { /* Draw rectangle */ }
}

class Circle implements Shape {
    public void draw() { /* Draw circle */ }
}
```

---

### **Slide 5: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
**Title:** Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
**Core Meaning:**  
- Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.  

**Intention:**  
- Ensures that derived classes extend the base class without changing its behavior.  

**Code Snippet:**  
```java
// Bad Example: Violating LSP
class Bird {
    void fly() { /* Fly logic */ }
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
    void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Ostrich can't fly");
    }
}

// Good Example: Adhering to LSP
class Bird {
    // Common bird behavior
}

class FlyingBird extends Bird {
    void fly() { /* Fly logic */ }
}

class Ostrich extends Bird {
    // Ostrich-specific behavior
}
```

---

### **Slide 6: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
**Title:** Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
**Core Meaning:**  
- Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.  

**Intention:**  
- Prevents "fat" interfaces and promotes smaller, more specific interfaces.  

**Code Snippet:**  
```java
// Bad Example: A single large interface
interface Worker {
    void work();
    void eat();
}

class Engineer implements Worker {
    public void work() { /* Work logic */ }
    public void eat() { /* Eat logic */ }
}

// Good Example: Segregated interfaces
interface Workable {
    void work();
}

interface Eatable {
    void eat();
}

class Engineer implements Workable {
    public void work() { /* Work logic */ }
}
```

---

### **Slide 7: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
**Title:** Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)  
**Core Meaning:**  
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.  
- Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.  

**Intention:**  
- Reduces coupling between modules.  
- Promotes the use of dependency injection.  

**Code Snippet:**  
```java
// Bad Example: High-level module depends on low-level module
class EmailService {
    void sendEmail() { /* Email logic */ }
}

class Notification {
    private EmailService emailService = new EmailService();
    void sendNotification() {
        emailService.sendEmail();
    }
}

// Good Example: Both depend on abstraction
interface MessageService {
    void sendMessage();
}

class EmailService implements MessageService {
    public void sendMessage() { /* Email logic */ }
}

class Notification {
    private MessageService messageService;
    Notification(MessageService messageService) {
        this.messageService = messageService;
    }
    void sendNotification() {
        messageService.sendMessage();
    }
}
```

User: is solid enforced from day 1? or, as we make code changes, we understand it's better to break things down into smaller chunks.

---

Great question! **SOLID principles** are not necessarily enforced from day 1, and they don't have to be. In fact, it's often more practical and realistic to **refactor code over time** as you gain a deeper understanding of the system and its requirements. Let’s break this down:

---

### **Slide 11: When to Apply SOLID Principles?**
**Title:** Is SOLID Enforced from Day 1?  
**Content:**  
- **Not always enforced from day 1:**  
  - Early in a project, the focus is often on delivering functionality quickly.  
  - Over-engineering upfront can lead to unnecessary complexity.  
- **Refactor as you go:**  
  - As the codebase grows, you’ll identify areas where SOLID principles can improve maintainability and scalability.  
  - Refactoring is a natural part of the software development lifecycle.  

---

### **Slide 12: Why Not Enforce SOLID from Day 1?**
**Title:** Why Delay Applying SOLID Principles?  
**Content:**  
1. **Unclear Requirements:**  
   - Early in a project, requirements may not be fully understood.  
   - Applying SOLID too early might lead to incorrect abstractions.  
2. **Premature Optimization:**  
   - Over-engineering before understanding the problem can waste time.  
   - Focus on solving the problem first, then refine the design.  
3. **Iterative Development:**  
   - Agile and iterative development encourages evolving the design as the system grows.  

---

### **Slide 13: When to Refactor for SOLID?**
**Title:** Signs It’s Time to Apply SOLID Principles  
**Content:**  
- **Code Duplication:**  
  - Repeated logic indicates a need for better abstraction (SRP, OCP).  
- **Rigid Design:**  
  - Difficulty adding new features without breaking existing ones (OCP, DIP).  
- **Fragile Code:**  
  - Changes in one part of the system break unrelated parts (SRP, LSP).  
- **Large Classes/Interfaces:**  
  - Classes or interfaces doing too much (SRP, ISP).  
- **Tight Coupling:**  
  - High dependency between classes makes testing and maintenance hard (DIP).  

---

### **Slide 14: Refactoring Example**
**Title:** Refactoring to SOLID Over Time  
**Content:**  
- **Initial Code (Monolithic):**  
  ```java
  class Report {
      void generateReport() { /* Generate report */ }
      void saveToFile() { /* Save to file */ }
      void printReport() { /* Print report */ }
  }
  ```  
- **Refactored Code (SOLID-Compliant):**  
  ```java
  interface ReportGenerator {
      void generate();
  }

  interface ReportSaver {
      void save();
  }

  interface ReportPrinter {
      void print();
  }

  class PDFReport implements ReportGenerator, ReportSaver {
      public void generate() { /* Generate PDF */ }
      public void save() { /* Save PDF */ }
  }

  class Printer implements ReportPrinter {
      public void print() { /* Print report */ }
  }
  ```

### **Slide 15: Balancing SOLID and Practicality**
**Title:** Balancing SOLID with Real-World Constraints  
**Content:**  
- **Start Simple:**  
  - Begin with a working solution, even if it’s not perfectly SOLID.  
- **Refactor Incrementally:**  
  - Apply SOLID principles as the codebase grows and pain points emerge.  
- **Avoid Over-Engineering:**  
  - Don’t force SOLID where it doesn’t add value.  
- **Team Collaboration:**  
  - Ensure the team understands SOLID principles and agrees on when to apply them.  

---

### **Slide 16: Conclusion**
**Title:** Key Takeaways  
**Content:**  
- SOLID principles are **guidelines**, not strict rules to be enforced from day 1.  
- Refactoring toward SOLID is a natural part of evolving a codebase.  
- Balance practicality with good design to avoid over-engineering.  

**Call to Action:**  
- Start small, deliver value, and refine your design as you go!  

---

This approach ensures that SOLID principles are applied **when they provide the most value**, rather than forcing them prematurely. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into any specific principle or refactoring technique!
