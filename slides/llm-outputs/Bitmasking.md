Bitmasking is a technique used in computer science and programming to manipulate and store data efficiently using binary representations. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to represent a set of flags, options, or states compactly. Below is an outline for slides that could be used to explain bitmasking:

- Subtitle: A Deep Dive into Binary Operations
- Your Name/Organization
- Date

### **Slide 2: Introduction to Bitmasking**
- **What is Bitmasking?**
  - A technique to store and manipulate data using binary numbers.
  - Each bit in a binary number represents a flag, state, or option.
- **Why Use Bitmasking?**
  - Compact representation of data.
  - Efficient memory usage.
  - Fast operations using bitwise operators.

---

### **Slide 3: Binary Basics**
- **Binary Numbers**
  - Base-2 number system (0s and 1s).
  - Example: `1010` (binary) = `10` (decimal).
- **Bits and Bytes**
  - 1 bit = 0 or 1.
  - 1 byte = 8 bits.

---

### **Slide 4: Bitwise Operators**
- **Common Bitwise Operators**
  - AND (`&`): Sets a bit to 1 if both bits are 1.
  - OR (`|`): Sets a bit to 1 if at least one bit is 1.
  - XOR (`^`): Sets a bit to 1 if only one bit is 1.
  - NOT (`~`): Flips all bits.
  - Left Shift (`<<`): Shifts bits to the left.
  - Right Shift (`>>`): Shifts bits to the right.
- **Examples:**
  - `5 & 3` = `1` (binary: `101 & 011` = `001`).
  - `5 | 3` = `7` (binary: `101 | 011` = `111`).

---

### **Slide 5: Bitmasking Concepts**
- **Mask**
  - A binary number used to manipulate specific bits.
  - Example: `00001111` (mask to extract the last 4 bits).
- **Setting a Bit**
  - Use OR (`|`) with a mask.
  - Example: Set the 3rd bit of `0100` to 1: `0100 | 0100` = `0100`.
- **Clearing a Bit**
  - Use AND (`&`) with the NOT of a mask.
  - Example: Clear the 3rd bit of `0110`: `0110 & 1011` = `0010`.

---

### **Slide 6: Practical Applications**
- **Flags and Permissions**
  - Represent user permissions (read, write, execute) using bits.
- **Subsets in Combinatorics**
  - Generate all subsets of a set using bitmasking.
- **Dynamic Programming**
  - Optimize state representation in problems like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

---

### **Slide 7: Example: Representing Permissions**
- **Scenario**
  - User permissions: Read (R), Write (W), Execute (X).
- **Bit Representation**
  - R = `100` (4), W = `010` (2), X = `001` (1).
- **Combining Permissions**
  - Read + Write = `110` (6).
  - Read + Execute = `101` (5).

---

### **Slide 8: Example: Subset Generation**
- **Problem**
  - Generate all subsets of a set `{A, B, C}`.
- **Bitmasking Approach**
  - Use 3 bits to represent inclusion/exclusion.
  - Example: `101` = `{A, C}`.
- **Total Subsets**
  - `2^3 = 8` subsets.

---

### **Slide 9: Advantages of Bitmasking**
- **Memory Efficiency**
  - Compact representation of data.
- **Speed**
  - Bitwise operations are fast and optimized by hardware.
- **Simplicity**
  - Simplifies complex state representations.

---

### **Slide 10: Limitations of Bitmasking**
- **Readability**
  - Code can become hard to read and debug.
- **Size Constraints**
  - Limited by the number of bits (e.g., 32-bit or 64-bit integers).
- **Overhead**
  - May require additional logic for complex scenarios.

---

### **Slide 11: Code Example**
- **Python Example: Checking Permissions**
  ```python
  READ = 0b100
  WRITE = 0b010
  EXECUTE = 0b001

  user_permissions = READ | WRITE  # 0b110

  # Check if user has write permission
  if user_permissions & WRITE:
      print("Write permission granted.")
  ```
