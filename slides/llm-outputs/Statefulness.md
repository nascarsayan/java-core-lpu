The stateful data associated with Hotstar in your cookies includes information such as:

1. **User Preferences:**
   - `SELECTED__LANGUAGE`: Stores the preferred language (`eng` in your case).
   - `loc`: Stores location-related data.

2. **User Authentication & Identification:**
   - `sessionUserUP`: Likely an encrypted token for session authentication.
   - `userHID`: Could be a unique user identifier.
   - `userPID`: Another identifier related to the user's profile.
   - `userUP`: Another token, possibly related to user permissions.

3. **Device & Application Data:**
   - `deviceId`: A unique device identifier.
   - `appLaunchCounter`: Tracks the number of times the app has been launched.

4. **Geographical Data:**
   - `userCountryCode`: Stores the country code (`in` for India).
   - `x-hs-setproxystate-ud`: Might be related to proxy or regional settings.

These cookies store stateful data, which helps Hotstar maintain session persistence, personalize the experience, enforce regional restrictions, and track user engagement. Let me know if you need further analysis!

### **Bearer Tokens and JWT: Stateless Identity Explained**

**1. Bearer Tokens**  
A bearer token is an access token that allows a client (e.g., a web or mobile app) to access protected resources on a server. The term *"bearer"* means that whoever possesses the token can use it to make API requests without additional authentication.

- Typically included in the HTTP `Authorization` header:  
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <token>
  ```
- No need for re-authentication while the token is valid.
- If intercepted, it can be misused unless additional security measures like HTTPS, expiration, and token refresh mechanisms are in place.

**2. JSON Web Token (JWT)**
A **JSON Web Token (JWT)** is a specific type of bearer token that is **self-contained** and **digitally signed**. It consists of three parts:

```
header.payload.signature
```

- **Header**: Specifies the type of token (`JWT`) and signing algorithm (`HS256`, `RS256`, etc.).
- **Payload**: Contains claims (data like user ID, roles, expiration time, etc.).
- **Signature**: Ensures integrity and authenticity using a secret key or public/private key pair.

**Example JWT:**
```json
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9
.
eyJ1c2VySWQiOiIxMjM0NTYiLCJyb2xlIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJleHAiOjE2OTAwMDAwMDB9
.
SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

Decoded payload:
```json
{
  "userId": "123456",
  "role": "admin",
  "exp": 1690000000
}
```

### **Stateless Identity and JWT**
JWT enables **stateless authentication**, meaning the server does **not** need to store user sessions in a database. Instead, authentication is **embedded** in the token itself.

#### **How Stateless Authentication Works:**
1. **User Logs In** ‚Üí Server validates credentials and issues a JWT.
2. **Client Stores JWT** ‚Üí In local storage, session storage, or a cookie.
3. **Client Makes Requests** ‚Üí Sends the JWT in the `Authorization` header.
4. **Server Verifies JWT** ‚Üí Decodes and validates the token without querying a database.
5. **Token Expiry or Revocation** ‚Üí When the token expires, the user must log in again.

#### **Benefits of Stateless Authentication:**
‚úî **Scalability** ‚Äì No need to store sessions, making it ideal for distributed systems.  
‚úî **Performance** ‚Äì No database lookups for each request.  
‚úî **Decentralization** ‚Äì Can be verified by multiple services without central session storage.  

#### **Challenges & Solutions:**
‚ùå **Token Theft** ‚Üí Use HTTPS, short expiration, and refresh tokens.  
‚ùå **Revocation Difficulty** ‚Üí Use token blacklists or store critical claims in a database.
