The formal category for **REST, GraphQL, gRPC, SOAP, etc.** is **"API Architectural Styles"** or **"Communication Protocols for Distributed Systems."**  

### **Formal Names and Categories**
| Name       | Category | Description |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| **REST (Representational State Transfer)** | **Architectural Style** | Uses HTTP and stateless communication with resources represented as URLs. |
| **GraphQL** | **Query Language for APIs** | Allows clients to specify exactly what data they need, reducing over-fetching. |
| **gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Call)** | **RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Framework** | Uses HTTP/2 and Protobuf for high-performance, low-latency communication. |
| **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)** | **Protocol** | Uses XML-based messaging over HTTP/SMTP for web services. |
| **WebSockets** | **Full-Duplex Communication Protocol** | Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between client and server. |
| **Webhooks** | **Event-Driven Communication** | Sends real-time notifications from one system to another via HTTP POST. |
