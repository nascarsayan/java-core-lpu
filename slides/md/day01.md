# Real-World Git Scenarios
A Practical Guide for Developers

---

## Scenario 1: The Quick Fix During Feature Development

### The Situation
- Working on a big feature
- Boss needs urgent bug fix in main branch

### The Solution
```bash
git stash save "feature-x-in-progress"
git checkout main
git checkout -b hotfix-urgent-bug
# Fix bug, then return to feature
git checkout feature-branch
git stash pop
```

### Remember
Think of `git stash` as a magical pocket for your unfinished work - like hitting pause on Netflix!

---

## Scenario 2: The Messy Main Branch

### The Problem
- Main branch has bad commits 
- Need to return to previous version

### The Solution
```bash
git log --oneline
git checkout -b recovery-branch <good-commit-hash>
git checkout main
git reset --hard <good-commit-hash>
```

### Key Point
It's like a time machine for your code - you can always go back to when things worked!

---

## Scenario 3: Juggling Multiple Tasks

### The Challenge
- Multiple features in development
- Need to switch between them quickly

### The Approach
```bash
# Feature 1
git checkout -b feature1
git stash save "feature1-progress"

# Feature 2
git checkout -b feature2
git stash save "feature2-progress"

# View stashed work
git stash list
```

### Pro Tip
Think of it as having multiple save slots in a video game!

---

## Scenario 4: Handling Merge Conflicts

### Steps to Resolution
1. Stay calm - conflicts are normal!
2. Use `git status` to identify conflicts
3. Look for conflict markers:
   - `<<<<<<<`
   - `=======`
   - `>>>>>>>`
4. Choose which changes to keep
5. `git add` resolved files
6. Complete merge with `git commit`

### Remember
It's just like choosing between two lunch options - you can pick one or combine both!

---

## Scenario 5: Branch Cleanup

### Commands
```bash
# View merged branches
git branch --merged

# Remove local branch
git branch -d old-feature-branch

# Remove remote branch
git push origin --delete old-feature-branch

# Clean up tracking branches
git remote prune origin
```

### Think of it as...
Spring cleaning for your repository!

---

## Quick Reference: Common "Help!" Moments

### Wrong Branch Commit
```bash
git stash
git checkout correct-branch
git stash pop
```

### Undo Last Commit
```bash
# Keep changes
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Remove changes
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```

---

## Practice Makes Perfect

### Exercise 1: Time Machine
- Make and commit changes
- Practice using `git log`
- Try `git checkout` with commit hashes

### Exercise 2: Branch Juggler
- Create multiple branches
- Make different changes
- Practice branch switching
- Use stash for incomplete work

---

## More Practice Exercises

### Exercise 3: Conflict Creator
- Create a merge conflict on purpose
- Practice resolution
- Try different merge tools

### Exercise 4: Clean-up Crew
- Create several branches
- Merge some branches
- Practice branch cleanup
- Learn repository maintenance

## Final Thoughts

Remember:
- Git is your safety net
- Don't fear experimentation
- You can always go back
- Practice regularly

Happy coding! ðŸš€
